# Elegant Brit theme

Simple, colorful, and elegant.  I am not the original author of the
Elegant Brit themes, just a fan who has modified and updated them to
work nicely with Ubuntu Unity, GNOME 3, and XFCE 4.12.

## Primary changes from the original versions

### GTK+ 2

* modified to play nicer with the XFCE 4.12 panel
* added a background color on menubars *(normally uses a pixmap
background, so the color isn't visible in normal GTK+ apps)* to fix a
bug with apps that only take colors from GTK+, mainly Chromium-based
apps like Atom

### GTK+ 3

* added styles for Client-Side Decorations
* fixes for the XFCE Indicator Plugin
* fixes for Geary
